# Windsurf Briefs — Revera clinic platform

**One file for all Windsurf work briefs.** New briefs get appended as a new section here; do not
create separate brief files. Completed briefs stay as a short archived record at the bottom.

Standing rules live in `.windsurf/rules/*.md` (loaded automatically) and `.windsurf/MEMORIES.md`.

# ACTIVE BRIEF

## Brief 13 — Phase 2: translate `AdminBookingsView.tsx` to Arabic

**Why this exists:** DEC-043 scoped Arabic to Reception = Bookings, Patients, POS, New Booking.
`AdminBookingsView.tsx` was already extracted *before* DEC-043 was written, so it never appeared in
Phase 1's brief list — and as a result its Phase 2 translation was never scoped either. It has
**zero** Arabic wiring today (no `lang`, no `dir`, no `adminTranslations` — confirmed by grep
2026-08-19) despite being one of the most-used Reception screens in the product. This was only
discovered while writing Brief 11. **No extraction needed — this is Phase 2 only.**

**Target:** `src/components/admin/bookings/AdminBookingsView.tsx` (1,308 lines).

**Measured scope (grepped 2026-08-19, re-confirm):** ~34 hardcoded strings, 0 `placeholder`
attributes, RTL-sensitive Tailwind = `text-left` ×6, `right-0` ×2. Same caveat as Brief 12: the
grep count is a floor — enumerate by reading.

**Wiring — this one needs it added, unlike Brief 12.** The component currently takes no `lang` prop
at all. Add `lang` and `t` props, add a `bookings.adminBookingsView` namespace to
`translations.ts` (note: `bookings` will be a **new top-level namespace** — the file currently only
has `patients`), and pass both down from `admin/page.tsx` at its render sites (~line 21753, plus a
second render site around ~21804 — check both, `page.tsx` renders this component more than once).

**Value/label separation — highest risk in this file.** It is full of reservation `status` strings
(`confirmed`, `checked_in`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `approved`, `rejected`) used in
comparisons, in `supabase.update({ status: ... })` calls (~lines 559, 573), and in
`getStatusBadgeClass()`. **Translate the displayed label only, via a lookup; never the compared or
written value.** RISK-054 already bit this exact component once — a display-normalised status leaked
into shared state — so be especially careful that nothing translated flows back into logic.

**Dates:** 2 `toLocale*` calls — leave hardcoded, same reasoning as Brief 12.

**Method / exit criteria:** identical to Brief 12 (per-component `dir`, logical properties, both
languages browser-verified, stored values confirmed unchanged, manual test checklist written).
Browser-verify the actual Reception flow in Arabic, not just that the page renders: approve a
booking, check one in, confirm the status badges still read correctly and the underlying record
still stores English.

# QUEUED BRIEFS — do these next, in this order

## Brief 14 — Phase 2: translate `AdminNewBookingView.tsx` to Arabic

Same situation and same reasoning as Brief 13 — already extracted, never translated, zero Arabic
wiring today. **Phase 2 only, no extraction.**

**Target:** `src/components/admin/bookings/AdminNewBookingView.tsx` (1,123 lines).

**Measured scope (grepped 2026-08-19, re-confirm):** ~38 hardcoded strings, **7 `placeholder`
attributes** (unlike Brief 13 — this is a form-heavy screen, so placeholders and any validation /
`alert()` copy matter here), RTL-sensitive Tailwind = `text-right` ×8, `right-0` ×1, `pr-3` ×1,
`left-0` ×1.

**Wiring:** add `lang`/`t` props and a `bookings.adminNewBookingView` namespace. If Brief 13 landed
first it will already have created the `bookings` top-level namespace — extend it, don't duplicate
it. Pass props from `admin/page.tsx` at its render sites (~21740 and ~21804 — again, more than one).

**Value/label separation:** session type (in-clinic / online), payment method, and any service or
branch identifier must keep English/DB values. Service names come from the DB and already have
`en`/`ar` columns — use those, do not copy service names into `translations.ts`.

**Dates:** 3 `toLocale*` calls — leave hardcoded.

**Method / exit criteria:** identical to Briefs 12-13. Browser-verify by actually creating a booking
in Arabic end-to-end and confirming the created record's stored fields are English.

# ARCHIVE — completed briefs

Kept as a short record only. Full detail of what was found and fixed lives in `ai_docs/RISKS.md`
(RISK-038 … RISK-050), which is the authoritative account.

### Brief 1 — Reception ↔ Doctor workflow defects (completed 2026-08-16)
Nine tasks covering RISK-038 (session total silently discarded — no `price` column),
RISK-039 (fabricated payment status / doctor / room), RISK-040 (orphaned & duplicate public
bookings), RISK-041 (admin booking captured no payment; unreachable fallback insert reported
success), RISK-045 (prescription save reported success on failure), RISK-047 (hardcoded doctor and
discarded requested time on approve), RISK-048 (ungated pulse counter, missing out-of-stock).

Review outcome: five defects found in the delivered work and fixed separately — a nullable column
coerced to 0 (reintroducing the "Paid" bug in narrower form), a React stale-closure read after the
setter that populates it, one numbered sub-point silently skipped, cache invalidation applied to 2
of ~20 call sites, and a PATCH payload missing fields the user can still change.

### Brief 2 — Wallet ledger & API authorization (completed 2026-08-16/17)
RISK-042: `wallet_txns` was never written by anything; POS wallet payments never deducted the
balance; package sales never updated `spent_amount` and hardcoded `payments.method` to `'cash'`.
Fixed via a shared `src/lib/wallet.ts` helper used at all four wallet write sites.
RISK-036: twelve routes with no server-side authorization, guarded **per method** so the public
site's unauthenticated reads keep working.

Review outcome: implementation was correct in every detail checked. One documentation error
(a claim that a defect was unfixed when it had been fixed) and one unrequested file deletion,
both corrected.

**What both briefs missed, and why the Phase 0 net exists:** neither review caught that
`GET /api/reservations` had no auth at all (RISK-049), or that Brief 1's public-booking PATCH calls
were being silently rejected with 401 by a pre-existing gate, meaning the bug they fixed was never
actually fixed (RISK-050). Both were found later by direct re-examination. Code review and a green
build did not surface either one — tests would have.

### Brief 3 — Phase 0: test infrastructure & regression net (completed 2026-08-17)
Installed Vitest, wired `npm run test` into `check`. 107 tests across 8 files: pure-logic coverage
for `billing.ts`, `customerIdentity.ts`, `packages.ts`, `ledger.ts`, `services.ts`,
`customerBalances.ts`; a named regression suite for RISK-012/043/049/DEC-023; and route-level auth
tests that import the real `GET`/`POST` handlers with `supabaseServer` mocked at the module boundary.
Deferred (logic not exported as pure functions, needs Phase 1 extraction): RISK-038…048, 050.

Review outcome: matched the report in every number checked — 107 tests, 0 type errors, no
application code touched. Went further than the brief's own "invert and confirm" requirement for
the one test that matters most: temporarily reverted the actual RISK-049 fix in
`src/app/api/reservations/route.ts` to its pre-fix, fully-open state and confirmed
`tests/routes/auth.test.ts` catches it — the same route a real PII leak reached production through,
now with a test that would have caught it the first time.

### Brief 4 — Phase 1 pattern-proving PR: extract Clinic Profile Settings (completed 2026-08-17)
Extracted `activeNav === "Clinic Profile"` from `admin/page.tsx` (8 `useState` calls,
`handleSaveClinicProfile`, ~90 lines of JSX) into
`src/components/admin/settings/ClinicProfileSettingsView.tsx`, taking one prop
(`authenticatedJsonHeaders`), per DEC-027/DEC-043. Moved verbatim — no behaviour change. Confirmed
RISK-058 (fields never hydrate from saved data) and RISK-001 (hardcoded Revera defaults) both left
untouched as required, both already logged separately.

Review outcome: matched the report in every number checked — diff is 2 insertions/117 deletions on
`page.tsx` (a pure structural move), `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `eslint` 0 errors (133 pre-existing
warnings, unchanged), `vitest run` 107/107 passing, all independently re-run rather than trusted
from the report. Proves the mechanical extract-and-test loop works — Phase 1 moves on to the
Reception wave next.

### Brief 5 — Phase 1, Reception wave: extract Patients in 4 ordered sub-PRs (completed 2026-08-17)
Scoping this brief found DEC-043's Reception wave was already 2/4 done before it was written —
`New Booking` and `Bookings` were both already extracted (`AdminNewBookingView.tsx`,
`AdminBookingsView.tsx`), and `activeNav === "Point of Sale"` turned out to be dead mock UI (hard
coded `MOCK_PRODUCTS`, no persistence, "Complete Payment" is just an `alert()`) — not the real POS,
which is the `product_sales`-backed "Sell Product" flow embedded inside Patients. Flagged as a
separate open product question, out of scope here.

That left Patients (~2,041 lines) as the entire remaining scope, mapped into 5 mutually-exclusive
regions and split into 4 ordered sub-PRs (smallest/most self-contained first), each its own commit:
Medical Report Modal (`MedicalReportModal.tsx`, ~88 lines), Medical Form/Intake Modal
(`MedicalFormModal.tsx`, ~239 lines), Customer Create/Edit Form (`CustomerFormModal.tsx`, 20 state
vars + save handler + 2 open handlers), Patients Directory/List Table
(`PatientsDirectoryView.tsx`, presentational, all shared state via props). Sub-PR 5 (the ~1,280-line
Customer Profile Drawer, which owns `viewingCustomerProfile` — 82 references file-wide) was
deliberately left out, needing its own investigation-then-brief cycle rather than the same template.

Review outcome: all 4 sub-PRs independently re-verified against the actual repo, not trusted from
the report — `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `eslint` 0 errors (137 warnings, consistent with pre-existing
patterns), `vitest run` 107/107 passing on the final combined state, all 4 component files present,
`admin/page.tsx` down from 27,733 to 26,763 lines. One process note: commits for Sub-PR 2 and 3
ended up commingled with an unrelated parallel workstream's changes (DEC-042's `reservation_products`
migration + API wiring, being built in the same working tree at the same time) — content in both was
correct and independently verified, but commit-message attribution for those two is not clean. Not
rewritten — pushed as-is per explicit direction, given the risk of rewriting history while a second
process might still be committing to the same branch.

### Brief 6 — Phase 2 setup + pattern-proving translation: MedicalReportModal (completed 2026-08-17)
Scoping this brief found two things worth correcting before it started: `DoctorAccountView`'s `lang`
state (the plan's own cited reference pattern) has no `localStorage` persistence at all, despite the
plan's own 2.2 calling for it — added as a deliberate improvement, not copied as-is. Separately,
`admin/page.tsx` already had a dead `lang` state (`useState<"EN"|"AR">("EN")`, never read, `setLang`
never called) — same shape of gap as `attachedProducts` (DEC-042), scaffolding declared and
abandoned. Replaced it rather than adding a second one, with lowercase `en`/`ar` matching Doctor
Portal and the public `LanguageContext`'s convention.

Delivered: admin-local `lang` state with `localStorage` persistence (`revera_admin_lang`), a
language toggle in the sidebar visually matching `DoctorSidebar`'s existing one, new
`src/components/admin/translations.ts` (`adminTranslations`, namespaced `patients.*`), and
`MedicalReportModal.tsx` fully translated — all 15 hardcoded strings (enumerated by reading the file
directly, not guessed) replaced with `t.*` lookups, `dir` attribute added, RTL audited (no
direction-sensitive Tailwind classes present).

Review outcome: matched the report in every number and file checked — diff touched exactly the 3
expected files, `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `eslint` 0 errors (131 warnings, pre-existing patterns),
`vitest run` 107/107 passing, `grep '>[A-Z]'` on the translated file returns 0 matches, all
independently re-run against the actual repo rather than trusted from the report. Proves the
translation mechanism end-to-end — next 3 Brief 5 components repeat Part B only, Part A's setup
doesn't need redoing.

### Briefs 7-9 — Phase 2 Reception translations: MedicalFormModal, CustomerFormModal,
PatientsDirectoryView (completed 2026-08-17)

Translated the remaining 3 Brief-5-extracted Patients components into Arabic, repeating Brief 6's
Part B pattern: `MedicalFormModal.tsx` (skin-type/concern value-label separation via
`t.skinTypes[...]`/`t.concerns[...]` lookups, stored values kept English), `CustomerFormModal.tsx`
(~40 strings, Gender dropdown, 8-option Referral Source dropdown), `PatientsDirectoryView.tsx`
(purely presentational, first component in the rollout with real RTL-sensitive Tailwind).

**Reported complete, independent re-verification found 3 gaps — the same failure shape DEC-043's
own "Correction to the plan's own framing" section had already flagged once (Doctor Portal:
extracted but not actually translated).** This is the second occurrence of that pattern:
1. Brief 8's Gender-dropdown fix was skipped — `<option value="Male">Male / ذكر</option>` (the
   pre-existing cramped-bilingual hack the brief explicitly said to fix) was left unchanged.
2. Value/label separation was never added for Brief 7's skin-type/concern buttons or Brief 8's
   referral-source options — raw English `.map()`-ed directly into the button/option label instead
   of going through a lookup object. Stored values were correctly still English (no data-shape
   regression) — only the display layer was wrong.
3. Brief 9's flagged RTL items (`left-3.5`/`pl-10 pr-4` on the search bar, `text-left` on table
   headers and both dropdown menus) were all still present, untouched, despite the brief calling
   this out explicitly as needing browser confirmation.

Review outcome: all 3 gaps closed in a follow-up pass. Two same-pattern items were also found and
fixed in the same pass, beyond the original 3: `MedicalFormModal.tsx`'s scrollable-content padding
(`pr-1` → `pe-1`, logical property) and `PatientsDirectoryView.tsx`'s filter-panel Gender/Status/
Referral `<option>` labels (translation keys already existed in `translations.ts` — added when the
gaps report was written — but were never wired into the JSX until this pass). `tsc --noEmit` 0
errors, `vitest run` 107/107 passing, all independently re-run against the actual repo. Manual test
checklist: `ai_docs/manual_tests/ADMIN_I18N_BRIEFS_7_9_GAPS_MANUAL_TESTS.md`. **Note for whoever
writes Brief 11+:** this is now the second time "extracted and reported translated" turned out to
mean "extracted, and the report overstated how much was actually translated" — treat completion
reports on this rollout with the same skepticism DEC-043 already recommended for the Doctor Portal.

### Brief 10 — Sub-PR 5: move `viewingCustomerProfile` state out of `admin/page.tsx` (completed 2026-08-19)

Moved `viewingCustomerProfile`/`setViewingCustomerProfile` and its ~15 supporting effects/handlers
(prescriptions, medical records, product balances, package sell/redeem, add-product, print) into a
new `src/components/admin/patients/useCustomerProfile.ts` hook, confirming Brief 5's own
investigation note that this state is not actually cross-section shared. `admin/page.tsx` down by
625 lines; the 5-tab, ~1,280-line Profile Drawer JSX itself stays in `page.tsx` as scoped —
deliberately not touched, that's Brief 11.

Review outcome: mechanical extraction dropped one line versus the original —
`setEditingPrescription(null)` in the drawer-close cleanup effect was missing, found by diffing the
moved block against the original line-for-line rather than trusting the report's "no behaviour
changes" claim. Not independently exploitable (`handleStartCreatePrescription`/
`handleStartEditPrescription` both reset the value before it's ever read in a save), but restored
before commit to match the brief's own requirement exactly. Browser-verified live per the brief's
"highest-PII-risk move" note: opened a patient, started an unsaved prescription draft with a
distinctive marker string, navigated to a different patient without saving, confirmed the draft did
not leak into the new patient's form (diagnosis field empty, name field correctly scoped to the new
patient). All 5 Profile Drawer tabs (Personal Info, Booking History, Prescriptions & Records,
Purchased Products & Cart, Purchased Packages) confirmed loading real data in the browser, not just
`tsc`. `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `eslint` 0 new errors (one pre-existing-pattern warning in the new
hook file — missing `authenticatedJsonHeaders` dep, same shape as the original, not introduced by
this move). The 5 vitest failures present in the working tree at commit time are unrelated —
Reception-dashboard/doctor-payroll test files from a separate, already-in-progress workstream that
predates this brief; confirmed via grep that none reference `viewingCustomerProfile` or
`useCustomerProfile`.

### Brief 11 — Sub-PR 5 Part 2: extract Customer Profile Drawer JSX out of `admin/page.tsx` (completed 2026-08-19)

Moved the ~1,300-line drawer block (5 tabs, 3 inline modals: log usage, add product, sell package)
out of `admin/page.tsx` into `src/components/admin/patients/CustomerProfileDrawer.tsx`, receiving
Brief 10's hook output as props rather than re-calling `useCustomerProfile()` — `page.tsx` keeps its
one call for the two `activeNav`-dependent effects Brief 10 left there. No translation in this
brief, per the extract-then-translate split; that's Brief 12.

Review outcome: structurally correct — `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, all 5 tabs and all 3 nested modals
independently browser-verified loading real patient data and opening correctly (log usage modal
verified by code read only, since it needs a patient with an existing product balance to trigger and
none was on hand; the other 4 tabs + 2 modals were exercised live). **Report explicitly admitted
browser verification was skipped** ("Playwright MCP server crashed mid-session, from killing all
node processes") and asked for manual verification instead of doing it — done independently rather
than accepted as-is. Side note: killing "all node processes" also killed an unrelated project's dev
server that happened to be running on the same port; not this repo's process to kill, worth knowing
for next time.

Found one real ESLint **error** (not a warning) in the new file — `react-hooks/purity` flagging a
`Date.now()` call during render in the Purchase History date column. Traced via `git log -S` to a
commit predating this whole Windsurf-briefs effort — pre-existing, not introduced by this
extraction. The reason it surfaced now: `page.tsx` at 25k+ lines was too large for the React
Compiler's purity checker to analyze (confirmed — 0 errors on the pre-extraction file despite the
identical line existing in it), so it silently never fired there; the newly-isolated, reasonably-
sized component is analyzable and caught it. Fixed to match the codebase's existing "never
fabricate, show em-dash" convention (RISK-039) instead of reading the render-time clock as a
fallback — browser-verified the empty-state path still renders correctly. `vitest run`: 597 passed,
6 expected fail, 0 unexpected (matches the report's number, independently re-run).


### Brief 12 — Phase 2: translate `CustomerProfileDrawer.tsx` to Arabic (completed 2026-08-19)

Translated the 1,539-line Profile Drawer (5 tabs + 3 inline modals) via a new
`patients.customerProfileDrawer` namespace in `translations.ts`. All 18 RTL-sensitive Tailwind
classes converted to logical properties exactly as scoped (`text-right`×10 → `text-end`,
`text-left`×5 → `text-start`, `right-1`×2 → `end-1`, `ml-2` → `ms-2`); all 7 placeholders
translated; `dir` applied on the component root only. Reused the existing
`medicalFormModal` skinTypes/concerns lookups rather than duplicating them.

Review outcome: the translation itself held up under checks that caught real gaps in Briefs 7-9 —
`grep '>[A-Z][a-z]'` returns 0, en/ar key parity is exact (345 keys each, verified by script, no
one-sided keys rendering `undefined`), every `toLocale*` call left on `en-GB`/`en-US` per DEC-043
(confirmed by diffing the commit: only surrounding copy changed, never a locale argument), and
value/label separation is correct throughout — payment methods keep `value="cash"` with Arabic
labels, reservation status goes through a lookup with the raw value still passed to
`getStatusBadgeClass()`, and stored skin-type/status values are unchanged.

**Two gaps found and closed.** (1) The package-history status badge still rendered
`String(pkg.status).replace("_"," ")` — the raw DB value — so an expired/used-up package showed
English text on an otherwise fully Arabic screen. The brief's own `>[A-Z][a-z]` scope grep could
not see it because it is an interpolated expression, not literal JSX text; this is precisely the
"the grep count is a floor, not a total — enumerate by reading" caveat the brief wrote in advance.
Fixed with the same lookup-plus-fallback shape already used for reservation status, so an
unrecognised status degrades to the old rendering instead of blank. Not exercisable in the browser
(needs a patient holding a non-`active` package; none available) — flagged as Pending in the
checklist rather than claimed as verified. (2) The manual test checklist required by the brief's
exit criteria and by CLAUDE.md was not written; written now as
`ai_docs/manual_tests/BRIEF_12_PROFILE_DRAWER_I18N_MANUAL_TESTS.md`.

Browser-verified independently in both languages: all 5 tabs and the Add Product / Sell Package
modals render fully Arabic, booking status shows `مكتمل` while the record keeps `completed`,
dates/money stay Western (`18 Aug 2026`, `2360 EGP`), and English mode reverts cleanly. `tsc` 0
errors, `eslint` 0 errors, `vitest` 597 passed / 6 expected fail (baseline unchanged).

**Process note:** Windsurf began Brief 13 in the same working tree while this verification was
running, so its in-progress `bookings.adminBookingsView` keys were already sitting uncommitted in
`translations.ts` — the same file this fix touches. Rather than repeat Brief 5's commit
commingling, only this change's own hunks were staged (built against `HEAD` and staged via
`update-index`), leaving Brief 13's work untouched in the working tree for its own commit.
